Feel free to explore each script to understand and learn more about the concepts covered in your master study program.

## Usage

To run any of these programs, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system. Navigate to the specific script's file and compile and execute it using the following commands:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output```
Make sure to replace filename.cpp with the desired script and output with a chosen executable name.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
